                What is a yurt?
            </strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
            the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
            walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be
            opened.

            <strong>
                How are the yurts furnished?
            </strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
            quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
            experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and 
            cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
            located in the lodge.

                What should I bring?
            </strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan
            to dress for changing weather with light layers of
            clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
            sense of adventure!
